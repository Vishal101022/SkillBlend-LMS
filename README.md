## :open_book: things i learned
1. How Next.js folder structure works (so many route.tsx files).
1. Dynamic routes.
1. Next.js has built-in navigation. Previously, I had used reactRouter.
1. Next.js loves server-side rendering (by default).
1. How to create APIs and test them through Postman.
1. Inbuilt Tailwind support, which makes project styling much faster with a ton of available classes.
1. TypeScript for type safety, which helps make large projects bug-free (though it sometimes makes me cry with the number of errors it gives).
1. Shadcn UI has many components that you can copy, paste, and customize, including forms, cards, and buttons.
1. How to upload thumbnails, attachments, and videos using UploadThing.
1. How to integrate video processing and player using MUX.
1. How to integrate authentication (Clerk) and payment processing using Stripe.
1. Learn about MongoDB Atlas database.
1. Prisma ORM, which acts as a bridge between the database and client.
1. For notifications, everyone's favorite is react-hot-toast.
1. Throughout the development, I noticed that TypeScript, Prisma, and Next.js caught every small error I made, which helped me find and fix bugs.
